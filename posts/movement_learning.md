Today robotics is more and more inspired by the behaviour of the human being. If we want robots to interact with the real world, we have to look toward the smartest creature, us. Thanks to different researches in science, now we can try to reproduce, although with limitations, all the ability of the human in a robot. The results of these researches can be seen in developmental robotics that merge robotics, biology and neuroscience. The best known example of developmental robotics is iCub [11] that is a humanoid robot used for research into human cognition and artificial intelligence. The iCub has demonstrated capabilities in successfully perform human-like tasks: crawling, vision processing functions, progressive language learning, manipulation functions and so on. One of the most controversial point in this field is the movement learning. While efficient movement planning in typical low dimensional industrial robots, usually characterized by three to six DOFs, is a complex problem, optimal planning in 30 to 50 DOF systems, like iCub, with uncertain geometric and dynamic models is really hard, especially if we aim at real-time performance in a robotic system.

In everyday life we are required to move in a changing environment. Despite these variations we are able to achieve our behavioural goals easily, thanks to the process of motor learning. Motor learning can be defined as a set of processes that, with exercises and experience, determines a relative change in performance and potentiality of the behaviour [12]. Also motor learning is generally conceived as the acquisition of new skilled movements. Learning is not directly visible, because the processes that determine changes are internal. If we observe an individual learning of a new movement, we may notice that the target is not immediately reached during its first attempts, in which executions are coarse or wrong, because learning is not that simple. The more the movement is complex, the more time is needed to learn it, adding new movement segments. Thus, learning requires repetitions. In 1975 Schmidt said that “the number of repeats of the movement to learn represent a basic element in order to form and strengthen the schema of the action. Such executions are necessary to store information on initial conditions, the parameters used in the response, on sensory feedback and the achieved results” [14].

The performances are improved from time to time at each new execution until the formation of a pattern relatively stable, by means of which the movement can come close to that intended. The beginning of learning process in humans occurs in newborn, which unconsciously learn to recognize and use their own body, thus beginning to interact with the environment. Furthermore, do not forget that the phenomenon is not a purely neurophysiological process, since it has also important psychological implications. Like guessed by Donald Hebb learning takes place as a process “experiencedependent” [15]; everything we experience can potentially significantly influence our neuronal connections and our brain, a phenomenon known by the term of neural plasticity.
According to the studies of Hebb about neural plasticity and of Ramon y Cajal, it was discovered that the hippocampus and its plasticity(LTP — Long-term potentiation) are the basis of cognitive learning and memory. It turned out that stimulation of sensory cortex could produce LTP in motor cortex [17]. This indicates that repeated practice of a movement, which sends input to sensory cortex produces LTP to the motor cortex. Insight into the neural basis of learning was derived also from progress in surgery. In 1957 Scoville and Milner reported a historical finding about the genesis of learning and memory. Scoville performed an operation to treat an epileptic patient by removal of the temporal cortex and the hippocampus. Although the operation was successful, this patient suffered from retrograde amnesia; he could not remember daily experiences, although he mantained long-term memories that he had acquired before the operation [18]. Similar observations were described in other patients and animals, and it is generally accepted that the hippocampus and related structures are involved in the memorization of recent memories.

There are various types of motor learning studied. Different studied on animals confirmed the important role of cerebellum and motor cortex in learning. Sasaki, working with the monkey, proposed the premotor and the frontal cortices [19] as well as the cerebellum as the sites for learning a conditioned response. Thompson and Woody have studied the conditioning of the eye-blink reflex in the cat and have proposed that the cerebellum and motor cortex are the sites for learning [20]. Another theory about motor learning is that linked to motor primitives. This theory said that the brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of these primitives, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system’s ability to learn action depends on the shape of its primitives. It has been shown that humans learn the dynamics of reaching movements through a flexible combination of primitives that have gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity [21]. These motor patterns are available from birth and they represent survival and exploratory functions, which enable humans to build sensorimotor maps that we use as the basis for other elements activities [1]. Some recent studies support this hypothesis and they say that the nervous system combines them based on the task you want to accomplish [2]. A test of the modular construction of the movement is observed by recording the EMG signals from a sample of individual. By applying to these signals to the decomposition algorithm, it has been observed common regularities in space-time between individuals and shared between different activities. In Fig. 1 EMG signals acquired during the experiment are then analyzed, and an algorithm of reduction of dimensionality is applied to get the synergies.
